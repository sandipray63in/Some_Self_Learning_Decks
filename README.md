1) Most of the slides images are taken from the internet and not made by myself although there are very few which I made myself.
2) I have not read/gone-through e2e of all the resources mentioned in the slides(especially the paid ones).For the paid ones, mainly checked the ToC(Table of Contents), reviews & other articles/blogs where they have been referred as recommended resources.
3) Some resources links might not be working due to various reasons, although they were working at the time of initial drafting.
4) Most of the slides needs beautification to make them more professional.
5) There are probably tons of better resources compared to the decks/slides/ppts provided here, especially the paid courses from Udemy or Corusera or Pluralsight or some similar sites.But this is kind of accumulation of some best of the best resources as per my limited knowledge that I have tried to put in a single centralised place which is not only helpful for myself but can be helpful for others as well.



N.B.- Regarding AI/ML/DL etc whatever amateur/novice level knowledge I have is all because of IISc B'Lore & my wife. Actually she did a course in CDS(Computational Data Science) from IISc B'lore as a start for her PhD in ML & that sparkled the interest in me(& ofcourse in her) to know more about AI/ML/DL etc.Hats off to the professors of IISc B'lore(e.g. [Sashikumar Ganesan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sashikumaar), [Deepak Subrahmani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepaknsubramani), [Yogesh Simmhan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simmhan/) etc) for making such complex subjects so simple to understand. Its now quite understandable to me (& ocourse my wife) why IISc B'Lore is considered the best Science & Engineering College in not only India but Asia as well üôè
